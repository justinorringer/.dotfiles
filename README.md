# My .dotfiles

Here's my .dotfiles repo with some settings I don't want to replicate.

If you want a backup yourself, follow [this amazing tutorial](https://youtu.be/CFzEuBGPPPg) by [DevInsideYou](https://www.youtube.com/c/DevInsideYou).

## Repository Layout
### Stow
For programs with true dotfiles, I used stow. 

See the ```/stow``` directory and [README](/stow/README.md)

### Deconf
For programs like Guake that don't use dotfiles, Deconf was used to dump the data into a file.

See the ```/deconf``` directory and [README](/deconf/README.md)

## More extensive examples
[dotfiles.github.io](dotfiles.github.io) has many user setting samples.
